We saw earlier that if $E \subset \mathbb{R}$ satisfies $\mstar{E} = 0$ then $E \in \mathcal{L}$.
In particular, $\forall F \subset E$, $\mstar{F} \leq \mstar{E} = 0$, so $F \in \mathcal{L}$ too.
This however totally fails when $\mstar{E} > 0$.

\begin{theorem}[Vitali]
    For any $E \subset \mathbb{R}$ with $\mstar{E} > 0$, there is an $F \subset E$ which is NOT measurable.
    The construction uses the axiom of choice (and it is really needed).
\end{theorem}

The proof of this theorem and construction of a Vitali set are currently omitted due to length.
